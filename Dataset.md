The dataset for your solar power prediction project was collected from the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) website. This database provides extensive solar radiation and meteorological data, which is essential for modeling and predicting solar power generation in specific regions.

Details about the dataset:

The NSRDB dataset includes weather parameters such as temperature, GHI (Global Horizontal Irradiance), pressure, humidity, and timestamps.

It provides data in CSV format, which can be downloaded directly from the NSRDB portal after selecting the relevant location and time period.

Your project specifically used weather data for Namakkal, Tamil Nadu, extracted from the NSRDB to train models for real-time solar power prediction.
